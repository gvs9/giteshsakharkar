                <h1>fairs & festivals of goa</h1>
                    <p>Being a predominantly Roman Catholic society,<br>
                         most of the festivals of Goa are Christianity-specific.<br>
                          Feast days, thanksgiving, monsoon celebrations, processions-all<br>
                           mark the Goanese calendar. Shigmo, the Goanese version of Holi, is<br>
                            celebrated in the month of February and March. The Feast of Our Lady of Miracles,<br>
                             celebrated 16 days after the Easter, is secular by nature and is celebrated with pomp <br>
                             and show by both Hindus and Christians. Igitun Chalne, held at Sirigao temple in Bicholim <br>
                             during May, is one of Goa's most distinctive festivals. The main attraction of the festival<br>
                             comes when devotees of Goddess Lairaya walk across burning coals to prove their devotion.</p>
